  <li>A mother was teaching her three year old daughter The Lord's Prayer. For several evenings at bedtime, she repeated it after her mother. One night she said she was ready to solo.

The loan officer wasn't sure so he went in to see the bank manager. "There is this small frog outside who needs to buy a new car, and the only collatteral he has is this"; and he handed the charm to the bank manager. The bank manager looked at the charm and said: "It's a knick-knack, Paddy Whack, give the frog a loan!" </li>

  <li>Two policemen are called to the scene of a crime in a convenience store. One asks the manager what happened. He replies "There's a man over there covered in Corn Flakes and he's dead."
